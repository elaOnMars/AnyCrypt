========

A prototype Chrome extension enabling encryption over any web platform, with the help of [keybase.io](https://keybase.io/).

The idea, is to show how easy encryption can and should be. This is a prototype, are several vulnrabilities. However, we felt it prudent to try to guage interest prior to commiting many hours to fixing various issues. Keep this in mind, when using our extension. 

Please, feel free to commit fixes!
